# Ligase Fidelity Profiling

This is an official repository for computational workflow on profiling ligase fidelity using PacBio SMRT sequencing. Please see citing information below.

# Prerequisites

The computational workflow requires a number of tools to be installed and available from the command line in your system.

## PacBio tools

* ```ccs``` - Generating circular consensus sequences (CCS) based on PacBio sequencing data. Available as part of [pbbioconda](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbccs).
* ```lima``` (optional) - Demultiplexing PacBio data. Available as part of [pbbioconda](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/pbbioconda).

## Third-party tools

* ```samtools``` - Handling high-throughput sequencing data. Available through [conda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/samtools) or [GitHub](https://github.com/samtools/samtools).
* ```pysam``` - Python module for handling sequencing files. Available through [conda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/pysam) or [GitHub](https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam).

## Custom PERL/Python scripts

These custom scripts are provided as part of Ligase Fidelity GitHub repository. The scripts must be made available from the command line in your system (for example, by adding the scripts directory to ```$PATH``` environment variable).

* ```cluster.pl``` - Identify top/bottom subreads in PacBio sequencing reads.
* ```split.pl``` - Split top/bottom subreads to separate files.
* ```suumarize_results.py``` - Extract overhang pairs and generate output tables summarizing results.

# Computational workflow

Processing PacBio sequencing data in the Ligase Fidelity computational workflow proceeds through a series of steps, where output of one step serves as input for the next step. As a result, this workflow produces a set of tables summarizing ligase fidelity data.

The ```scripts/``` directory contains an example workflow (```workflow.sh```) that can be executed from the command line. Before executing the example workflow, make sure that the ```$LIGASE_FIDELITY_DIR``` environment variable in ```workflow.sh``` points to the Ligase Fidelity GitHub repository on your computer.

The computational steps are described below.

## Example PacBio BAM sequencing data

For the purpose of this example, you can download PacBio sequencing data for the b4 substrate sequencing.

```
wget https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/sra70/SRZ/019043/SRR19043774/lib26.bam
```

For convenience, we define a set of environment variables to define location of the input data files and the output directory. Please update these variables according to your computational environment.

Input PacBio BAM subreads file:
```
subreads=$PWD/movie.subreads.bam
```

Reference FASTA file:
```
reference=$LIGASE_FIDELITY_DIR/references/b4.fasta
```

Output directory:
```
rundir=$PWD/ligase_fidelity_output
```

This repository comes with the reference FASTA files for the 4-base overhang substrate (```b4.fasta```).

## Cluster and split top/bottom strands

In this step, ```cluster.pl``` script detects a continuous stretch of insert sequences separated by adapter sequences (based on expected lengths of insert and adapter sequences) in PacBio long polymerase reads. Then ```split.pl``` script splits detected insert sequences to two separate groups.

```
### create output directory for clustered reads
jobdir=$rundir/01-cluster
mkdir -p $jobdir
cd $jobdir

echo "cluster.pl"
time cluster.pl --insert_length 98 ${subreads} | bzip2 - > clusters.csv.bz2

echo "split.pl"
time split.pl ${subreads} clusters.csv.bz2

echo "samtools (1)"
time samtools view -Sb subreads.fwd.sam > subreads.fwd.bam

echo "samtools (1)"
time samtools view -Sb subreads.rev.sam > subreads.rev.bam
```

## Build CCS sequences

PacBio ```ccs``` tool builds consensus sequences for "top" and "bottom" strands for each sequenced product.

```
### create output directory for consensus reads
jobdir=$rundir/02-ccs
mkdir -p $jobdir
cd $jobdir

echo "ccs (1)"
time ccs \
    --report-file=subreads_ccs.fwd.csv \
    --log-file=subreads_ccs.fwd.log \
    --num-threads=8 \
    --min-passes=1 \
    $rundir/01-cluster/subreads.fwd.bam subreads_ccs.fwd.bam

echo "ccs (2)"
time ccs \
    --report-file=subreads_ccs.rev.csv \
    --log-file=subreads_ccs.rev.log \
    --num-threads=8 \
    --min-passes=1 \
    $rundir/01-cluster/subreads.rev.bam subreads_ccs.rev.bam
```

## Summary tables

The resulting consensus sequences for both strands are processed, all unique overhang (and barcode) sequences are tabulated and processed to generate a set of output tables. See interpreation of results section below.

```
### create output directory for summary tables
jobdir=$rundir/02-summary
mkdir -p $jobdir
cd $jobdir

echo "summarize_results.py"
time summarize_results.py $rundir/02-ccs/subreads_ccs.{fwd,rev}.bam
```

# Insert structure of the b4 substrate

The double stranded insert for the b4 substrate is schematically presented below. The Ligase Fidelity scripts are aimed at extracting the overhang and barcode sequences for each sequenced product. This is achieved by aligning consensus sequences of both top and bottom strands to the expected reference sequence and extracting sequence fragments corresponding to overhangs and barcodes. Additionally, the scripts extract the constant regions immediately adjacent to the overhang and barcode regions to ensure correcteness of the mapped consensus sequences.

```
